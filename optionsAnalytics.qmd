## Who Am I?

Quarto is great for sharing my train of thought...

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-j-townsend/) and [X / Twitter](https://x.com/justinjtownsend)

I tend to like the things I like.

## What interests me on the side? {.smaller}

-   I'm a regular user of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) since \~2016
-   It's the welcoming community, especially the R/Finance [^1] community...
-   Which has allowed me to make uncountable mistakes along the way

[^1]: R/Finance is now the Open Source Quantitative Finance community [OSQF](https://www.osqf.org/)

SO I've stuck with it and not deviated too much.

### BUT...

-   I use R for other topics TOO, particularly sports analysis

## An Options Analytics journey begins... {.smaller}

Thanks to my brother and the purchase of [Sheldon Natenberg's, Option Volatility & Pricing 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Option-Volatility-Pricing-Strategies-Techniques/dp/155738486X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0) in May of 2008 for getting me started.

Thanks to [Marcos Lopez Del Prado, Advances In Financial Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Advances-Financial-Machine-Learning-Marcos/dp/1119482089/ref=sr_1_2_sspa) purchased March of 2019 and [Euan Sinclair, Volatility Trading](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Volatility-Trading-Website-Wiley/dp/1118347137/ref=sr_1_1) purchased May of 2022 for keeping my interest up.

And thanks to my derivatives professor Dr. Igor Makarov, now at [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/finance/people/faculty/Makarov)...

## Experience with the FinTwit Community {.smaller}

I find FinTwit it a bit overwhelming, but FWIW my own honor roll of generally exceptional contributors:

## Giants of R in Finance {.smaller}

From time-to-time you want to translate all those research ideas into R code and discover your own mispricings.

Thanks to giants in this space including...

-   [Josh Ulrich](https://www.joshuaulrich.com/) of [quantmod](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/index.html) fame [^2]
-   [Dirk Eddelbuettel](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/) for SOO much, but [RQuantLib](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rquantlib.html) is a favorite

[^2]: Mild panic induced in me in January 2023 by [Issue #407](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/quantmod/issues/407), looks like I'll need to pay for a data source. WOT? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## My Own Babysteps {.smaller}

-   Quantmod produces a list of dataframes for core Calls and Puts data

``` r
library(quantmod)

SPX.OPT <- getOptionChain("SPX", api.key = Sys.getenv("ORATS_API_KEY"))
```

-   Toys out of pram moment, data not "side-by-side", so I write my own [orats.functions](https://gist.github.com/justinjtownsend/8c7175222118e2eec6a839de82c2957c)

    -   Turns out "side-by-side" was available from the source endpoint...

``` {.R code-line-numbers="10,11"}
library(polite)

orats.ticker <- "SPX"
orats.tradeDate <- as.character(Sys.Date())
orats.bow <- bow(url = ORATS_BASEURL, user_agent = ORATS_USER,force = TRUE)
orats.session <- polite::nod(bow = orats.bow,
    path = paste0(
      "/datav2/hist/strikes?", "token=", Sys.getenv("ORATS_API_KEY"), "&ticker=", orats.ticker,
      "&tradeDate=", orats.tradeDate
    )
  )

SPX.OPT <- scrape(session, content = "text/plain; charset=UTF-8")
```

-   Hey-ho, lesson learned... look harder!

## Not quite finished here... {.smaller}

Chrome PDF engine clips footnotes and a mystery blank page is added to the end, so...

``` javascript
npm install -g decktape
```
