# optionsAnalytics

Writing well is an area of constant improvement for me. While I am improving I'll do my audience the courtesy of being brief.

For the longest time I've held an amateur interest in options, in the last 3-5 years this has extended into more specific study into the practical applications of these theories into project management on top of pricing of financial instruments. Which is fun, honest... ;-)

## Purpose
This package / project demonstrates the application of data science techniques (using R) towards a more formal specification of engineered product that can run reliably in a production setting.

Packages, on which this project depends, have their boundaries. Once these boundaries are reached, one must put one's best foot forward with independent  code and workflow design which can co-exists in a rapidly changing future for software.

***3rd May 2024*** - at the time of putting pen to paper in this sentence, it is said that AI will soon be able to make all decisions that can be automated. It is my distinct hope the future is a little more nuanced than that... that CREATIVITY still counts in (code) design.

# Thanks...
This package draws heavily on giants in the R/Finance community to support it's publication.

Thanks must go in particular to Josh Ulrich, of quantmod fame, and Dirk Eddelbuettel for his RQuantLib package.

This is a line from RStudio This is another line, just confirming my PAT is stored in gitconfig. :-)

And another one, this will be GREAT!!

And yet another are they stored this time?

Now what, let's check?

And let's just double-check?

# An entry from the remote repo on GitHub.

The remote change pulled down using this container was able to use the cached credentials for the pull.

Returning these changes as a push, then I'll kill this container and see if the cache option is still working. :-)

Now what are they in cache?

Initial pull doesn't respect previous cache setting, but the subsequent push did. Makes me think the cache is torn down at the end of the container session?

TEST to persistent volume.

Another check, did the transition work?
