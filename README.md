# optionsAnalytics

Repository for testing my Git/GitHub setup for optionsAnalytics code

This is a line from RStudio This is another line, just confirming my PAT is stored in gitconfig. :-)

And another one, this will be GREAT!!

And yet another are they stored this time?

Now what, let's check?

And let's just double-check?

# An entry from the remote repo on GitHub.

The remote change pulled down using this container was able to use the cached credentials for the pull.

Returning these changes as a push, then I'll kill this container and see if the cache option is still working. :-)

Now what are they in cache?

Initial pull doesn't respect previous cache setting, but the subsequent push did. Makes me think the cache is torn down at the end of the container session?
